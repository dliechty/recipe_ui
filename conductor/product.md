# Product Guide

## Vision

Recipe UI is a meal-planning-first application for home cooks and families. The product prioritizes an excellent meal planning experience, with recipe management and household collaboration designed to support and enhance that core workflow.

## Target Users

### Home Cooks
Individuals who want to organize their personal recipe collection and plan meals efficiently. They benefit from streamlined recipe entry, powerful search and filtering, and intuitive weekly meal planning tools.

### Households & Families
Multiple users within a family unit who share recipes, coordinate meal plans together, and collaborate on shopping for the household. The collaborative features are designed around the family as the primary unit, enabling shared visibility into what's being cooked and what needs to be purchased.

## Core Goals

### 1. Meal Planning (Primary)
The central experience of the application. Users should be able to plan meals across days and weeks with minimal friction, making daily cooking decisions simple and grocery shopping efficient. The meal planning workflow drives the overall product design.

### 2. Recipe Management (Supporting)
Create, store, search, and filter a personal and shared recipe collection with detailed ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information. Recipe management exists to feed into and support the meal planning experience — recipes are the building blocks of a meal plan.

### 3. Family Collaboration (Supporting)
Enable household members to work together on meal planning and shopping. Family collaboration ensures that meal plans reflect the needs and preferences of the whole household, and that shopping responsibilities can be shared and coordinated.

## Key Differentiators

- **Meal-planning-first design:** Every feature is evaluated through the lens of how it improves the meal planning experience.
- **Family-oriented collaboration:** Collaboration is built around the family unit, supporting shared meal plans and coordinated shopping.
- **Recipe management as infrastructure:** Recipes are structured and searchable to make meal plan creation fast and intuitive, with advanced filtering, multi-step forms, and drag-and-drop organization.
