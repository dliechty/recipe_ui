{"id":"recipe_ui-979","title":"Show recipe name in Recipe Box list items","description":"When a recipe list is expanded in the Recipe Box page, each recipe item only shows 'View Recipe →' and the added date. Users cannot identify which recipe is which without clicking through.\n\nThe RecipeListItem API type only contains recipe_id, id, recipe_list_id, and added_at - it does NOT include the recipe name.\n\n## Solution\nCreate a RecipeListItemDisplay component that:\n1. Accepts recipeId and addedAt props\n2. Uses useRecipe hook to fetch recipe details\n3. Shows loading skeleton while fetching\n4. Displays recipe name as primary text with 'View Recipe →' as secondary\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Recipe name is visible in the expanded list view\n- Loading state shows skeleton/placeholder while fetching\n- Test coverage for the new component\n- Confirm remove functionality confirms with recipe name (not 'this recipe')","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"qwertyshoe@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-26T21:58:42.016528458-08:00","created_by":"dliechty","updated_at":"2026-01-26T22:02:47.411146672-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-26T22:02:47.411146672-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented RecipeListItemDisplay component that fetches and displays recipe name"}
